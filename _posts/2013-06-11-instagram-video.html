    <h4>Photos of You - Instagram Video</h4>
    <p>Back in April I had the opportunity to be a part of a promotional video for Instagram's new Photos of you feature. We spent an entire Saturday at Keegan Jones's Apartment in the heart of The Mission district in San Francisco. Here we filmed scenes for the video, took portraits of each other, ate Delfina Pizza and drank beer. Keeg's apartment was the perfect setting for a group of photographers to get together. His outdoor patio overlooked Dolores Park with sweeping view of The Mission. We even got adventurous and climbed the roofs of the <a href="http://instagram.com/p/Xymib5lGOM/" target="_blank">surrounding apartments</a>.</p>

    <p>In the days leading up to the event I had no idea what to expect. I had the nagging feeling that it might feel scripted and played out. But in the end it couldn’t be further from that. Hanging out with all those folks that day felt completely normal and right. It's an amazing feeling when so many creatives come together under one roof.</p>

    <p>Back in October of 2012 I moved from Phoenix to San Francisco. It was an intimidating move, at that time I knew almost no one in San Francisco except a few loose connections. I also had no geographic knowledge of the city, except there was this place called the Tenderloin that I wasn’t supposed to go to. It was a leap in the dark, one that would end up being the most rewarding moves in my life.</p>

    <p>Through Instagram I’ve been able to meet more people than I ever could have imagined. Everyone I’ve met through Instagram has been an inspiring and caring individual. Something about producing compelling images in an instant and location based manner that’s made it so easy to connect with folks over common interests that we share through photography. I've even met amazing individuals who live in the same apartment complex as me that I never would have gotten to know were it not through Instagram.</p>

    <p>The Facebook video team did an incredible job on the production (Nate, Matt, & Alejandro). I'm so grateful to the Instagram community team for letting me a part of such a fun day and to help promote a product I love and use daily.</p>
