title: Hello World
subtitle: Why and how I now host all my projects on Github
summary: Last week I popped open an outdated version of Filezilla, looked up FTP credentials for my ancient 1&amp;1 hosting in a Google spreadsheet, then proceeded to overwrite every remote file because I couldn't remember what was up-to-date. Fixing my hosting and deploy process was on my todo list for months, but it consistently took a backseat to sexier projects. I'm happy to announce I finally addressed it and am now 100% hosted on Github.
